Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, in the town of Vinci, in the Tuscany region of Italy.
He was the illegitimate son of a Florentine notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman named Caterina.
Despite his irregular birth, Leonardo received an informal education in Latin, geometry, and mathematics.

At the age of fourteen, Leonardo began an apprenticeship with the renowned Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio.
In Verrocchio's workshop, he learned painting, sculpture, and mechanical arts.
His talent quickly surpassed that of his master, and he began receiving independent commissions by his early twenties.

Leonardo is best known for two of the most famous paintings in the world: the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper.
The Mona Lisa, painted between 1503 and 1519, is celebrated for the mysterious expression of its subject and Leonardo's use of sfumato, a technique of soft, blended transitions between light and shadow.
The Last Supper, painted on the wall of a Milan refectory between 1495 and 1498, depicts the moment Jesus announces that one of his apostles will betray him.

Beyond painting, Leonardo was a prolific inventor and scientist.
His notebooks, of which over 7,000 pages survive, contain detailed drawings and notes on topics ranging from anatomy and geology to hydraulics and flight.
He designed early concepts for the helicopter, solar power, the calculator, and plate tectonics — all centuries before they were realized.

Leonardo studied human anatomy by dissecting over 30 human corpses, producing anatomical drawings of extraordinary precision.
His studies of the heart, muscles, and skeleton remained among the most accurate until the 19th century.
He also made significant contributions to botany, cartography, and civil engineering.

In 1482, Leonardo moved to Milan to work for Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan.
He spent seventeen years there, working as a painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer.
During this period he produced The Last Supper, the equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza (never completed), and numerous studies on city planning and hydraulics.

Leonardo spent the last three years of his life in France, at the invitation of King Francis I.
He lived in the Château du Clos Lucé, near the royal Château d'Amboise.
He died on May 2, 1519, at the age of 67, reportedly in the arms of the king.

Leonardo da Vinci is universally regarded as one of the greatest geniuses in human history.
His combination of scientific rigor and artistic mastery remains unparalleled.
He embodied the Renaissance ideal of the uomo universale — the universal man — who seeks knowledge across all disciplines.
