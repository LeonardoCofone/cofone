Cofone is a Python library for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
It allows anyone to transform their documents, notes, and texts into an intelligent knowledge base.
With just a few commands, you can query this base using LLMs, obtaining precise answers, summaries, or explanations — without complex configurations.

The library is modular: you can add extra tools, intelligent agents, and visual debugging.
It also features a mini-DSL that makes the code more natural and readable.
The idea is to make AI accessible, powerful, and customizable, leaving the developer full creative freedom without sacrificing simplicity and speed.

Cofone supports multiple retrieval strategies. The default one is BM25, a classic keyword-based ranking algorithm that works well for most use cases and requires no extra dependencies.
For more advanced semantic search, Cofone integrates FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) combined with sentence-transformers embeddings.
This approach finds conceptually related chunks even when the exact query words do not appear in the text.

The chunking system is one of Cofone's core strengths.
Instead of blindly splitting text every N characters, Cofone uses a smart chunker that respects the natural structure of the document.
It first tries to split by paragraphs, and if a paragraph is too long, it further splits it into sentences.
This preserves semantic coherence and improves retrieval quality significantly.

Cofone supports four chunking modes: smart (default), paragraphs, sentences, and fixed.
Each mode is suited for different types of documents.
For example, fixed mode works well for raw data exports, while smart mode excels with structured articles and notes.

Multiple LLM providers are supported out of the box: OpenRouter, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Ollama for local inference.
The provider is automatically detected from the model name, so you rarely need to specify it explicitly.
For example, passing model='gpt-4o-mini' automatically routes the request to OpenAI, while model='gemini-2.0-flash' routes it to Gemini.

Cofone is designed for developers who want to build RAG pipelines quickly without wrestling with boilerplate code.
A typical use case involves loading a folder of PDFs, indexing them, and asking questions in natural language.
Another common use case is building a personal knowledge assistant that combines local notes with web content fetched in real time.

The library is open source and available on GitHub.
Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome.
The project follows a clean, minimal code style with no inline comments, favoring self-explanatory naming and concise logic.

Version 0.1.0 is the first public release.
Future versions will include persistent vector stores (ChromaDB), streaming responses, agent-based tool use, and a CLI interface.
